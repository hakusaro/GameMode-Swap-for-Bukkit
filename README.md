# GMSwap
====

GMSwap allows Bukkit users to be granted permission to change gamemodes, without being operators.

It only permits admins to change their own gamemodes, and toggles them back and forth instead of making it a direct setting.

## Installation

Give a player the permission 'shankshock.gmswap.'

## Usage

From inside the Bukkit server, a player can run _/gmswap_ and will change gamemodes back and forth.
